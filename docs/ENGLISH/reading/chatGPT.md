## 原文

“The age of AI is upon us,” Microsoft’s chief executive Satya Nadella declared last week.

The giant software company is certainly backing its grand talk with hard cash and computing power. Last month, Microsoft announced it was investing a further $10bn in OpenAI, the San Francisco-based research company that has electrified the digital world with the launch of its ChatGPT language-generation model.

Within a week of opening up ChatGPT to the public, 1mn users were experimenting with the super-sophisticated chatbot to write reams of highly plausible text at astonishing speed.

Such “large language models”, as they are called, are not new, but never before have they been made so widely accessible. Even the British finance minister Jeremy Hunt (or his speechwriter) employed ChatGPT to compose the introduction to his recent speech on innovation

Despite the broader tech market downturn, venture capital firms have been frenziedly pouring billions of dollars into start-ups to exploit the commercial opportunities of these “generative” AI models.

Trained on huge amounts of content drawn from the internet, these models can also be used to generate computer code, images, audio and video. The next big thing in AI this year may well be the emergence of multi-modal models that mix several of these elements. “The quality and capabilities of generative models for imagery, video, and audio has shown truly stunning and extraordinary advances in 2022,” wrote Jeff Dean, one of Google’s most senior AI researchers.

Tech evangelists argue that the widespread adoption of generative AI opens up a new era in technology, just as the emergence of personal computers, smartphones and social media gave birth to seemingly limitless business opportunities in earlier times. Generative AI may yet transform the creative industries, video games production and enterprise software, for example. One of the open questions surrounding its use is whether it will strengthen the power of the tech incumbents, including Microsoft and Google, or stimulate fresh competition from insurgent start-ups, such as Cohere, Stability AI and You.com.

But the widespread adoption of generative AI is also triggering concerns about the theft of copyright, the spread of disinformation and deepfakes and the debasement of knowledge on the world wide web. Generative AI systems are trained to produce the most statistically probable answer, not the most accurate, and can “hallucinate” facts. ChatGPT has been described as “the greatest bullshitter ever” by Arvind Narayanan, a computer science professor at Princeton University.

The digital gold rush around generative AI may also be distracting us from more profound and productive uses of other machine learning models, according to one tech executive. While everyone is fixated on the industry’s “shiny new toy”, researchers have been using machine learning systems to diagnose cancers, model protein structures, optimise electricity grids and design components for heart valves, aero engines or wind turbines.

The age of AI may well be upon us, but not quite in the way we — and our digital assistants — are currently all chatting about.
