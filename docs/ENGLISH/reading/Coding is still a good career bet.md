### Coding is still a good career bet

*Tech job losses and AI advances do not mean computers can program themselves*

 

“Just one word . . . plastics” is the career advice offered by the family friend Mr McGuire to a bemused Benjamin Braddock, played by Dustin Hoffman, in the 1967 movie The Graduate. A modern-day Mr McGuire might well advocate coding as the route to decently paid job security. Or he might have done before the tech industry axed 200,000 jobs in the past 12 months — and the clamour around the artificial intelligence platform ChatGPT raised awareness that machines can write code, too. Computers, it seems, may soon be programming themselves. So is what we’ve been telling our kids about safe jobs all wrong?

Parental panic would be premature. Widespread lay-offs may indeed signal that the days of perpetual growth in Big Tech companies are ending and they are starting to behave more like banks — hiring in good times and firing in bad. Some are, for the first time, being pressed by activist investors to raise profitability. But after their extraordinary hiring sprees during lockdown, the job cuts represent only a modest retrenchment. Many of the axed roles are in sales and marketing, not programming. And if the arms race among tech companies to secure computer science graduates is abating, other previously outgunned sectors — from engineering to media and finance — will be happy to pick up the spare talent.

The need for software will only grow. The pandemic drove demand from consumers needing to work, shop, educate and entertain themselves at home — and from businesses struggling to control supply chains. Now organisations are looking to IT to blunt the impact of inflation. Robotics, automation, and the digitisation of even everyday products will require a lot more code. And a lot of legacy systems will need replacing.

Rather than being a big threat to coders, generative AI can help. Computers are unlikely to be writing their own programs any time soon, but Copilot, a kind of super-smart autocomplete function for coding from Microsoft’s GitHub division, is already raising productivity. Coders write a prompt on what they’re aiming to do and Copilot suggests lines of code. Andrej Karpathy, a former director of AI at Tesla, tweeted last month that Copilot was writing 80 per cent of his code, with 80 per cent accuracy. Programmers say the tool both speeds up their work and frees them to be more creative.

Advances are also opening coding to non-specialists. Low-code or no-code development platforms allow users to create application software by using a graphical interface. Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella suggests this could help close skills gaps: someone with expertise in, say, media or logistics, but no coding knowledge, can get involved in developing business apps. This shifts the balance a little towards business units and away from IT.

Those who understand coding from scratch will still be needed — not least to oversee the AI and correct any machine-generated mistakes. But as the grunt work is automated away, their skills will have to move up the value curve. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics projects US employment among “programmers”, narrowly defined, will fall 10 per cent over the next decade, but sees the number of software developers, including those responsible for planning, quality assurance, testing and integration, rising by a quarter.

If automation makes the best IT brains more productive, this is a good thing. Scaling the capabilities of talented people is likely to lead to more breakthroughs. Computers taking over more technical work as humans move up to a higher level of abstraction has been happening since the dawn of computing. For the graduates of today, that means coding is still a good place to start.

**至此第1段结束，段落大意：**

以电影名场面开场，引出计算机作为新兴火热行业，最近却时运不齐，命途多舛（裁员和人工智能高速发展）。究竟是我们所想的这样吗？

现在替计算机行业担心还是为时过早，1.现在裁员的是疫情封锁期间招人过剩；2.大部分科技公司裁员也针对的事销售和市场，不是编程人员；3.即使科技大厂减少找计算机专业的学生了，其他行业也十分愿意去接受这些spare talent.

技术进步让不懂代码的人也能develop applications，不需要专业人士了。不过这似乎与主题：计算机行业没有衰退的  背道而驰了，看看下面。

**至此第7段结束，段落大意：**

自动化，AI作为辅助能更好的让高精尖人才做出重大突破。计算机行业仍然是不错的选择。

本文主要从两个担忧论证计算机依然能行：

1、大裁员，不需要计算机人才了；

2、AI崛起

作者逐一进行了回答，用的例子也比较新鲜，但是每一个小论据铺垫太长导致逻辑上可能有些混乱。
